# SBU_dataset_process
a python code to pre-process of SBU Kinect Interaction Dataset: https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~kyun/research/kinect_interaction/index.html


You should check the jupyter notebook "download.ipynb"

it includes:
+ the code to display the dataset,
+ the code to directly download the dataset and unzip the dataset.
+ the code to load the dataset to json files
+ the code to split it to training data and val data
+ the code to interpolate to the same size (need pytorch)

There may be some adjustment for your own case.
